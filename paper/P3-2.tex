\begin{abstract}
Caltech/IPAC Firefly astronomical visualization software was used as a Python client to control the pointing of a telescope.
During Caltech Astroinformatics 2019 Hackathon, i worked on a project proposed by Alberto Krone-Martins and came up with the idea to extend the project using Firefly as a feature-rich visualization tool to enhance the observing experience.
The original hackathon project idea was about improving and making more accurate the autonomous telescope and satellite control pointing using machine learning from a training set of few images to eliminate the 'noise' coming from the control system.
Once the control loop is complete and working, the observer could use Firefly to select the target and activate the telescope control system to accurately point to the sky and make the observation.
The poster will explain the concepts and walk through each of the building block required to put together such system in place using docker and python. The result software stack can be found here: https://github.com/ejoliet/indi-firefly

\section{The project}

The problem we propose to solve is to control accurately and automatically the telescope pointing and tracking of a target without the need of manual adjustments (structural noise, temperature, gyroscopes, etc.).
The idea came up during Caltech's Astroinformatics hackathon 2019, Alberto Krone-Martins proposed to improve the telescope pointing control using machine learning and automation loop with INDI \footnote{https://www.indilib.org} controller via Python API.
The solution envisioned was to take full advantage of feature-rich visualization client tool such as Firefly\footnote{https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/firefly} and Python client API to control and point/measure devices compatible with INDI drivers.

The current software stack is a Docker image that includes INDI client/server hub and Firefly/INDI Python client code\footnote{https://github.com/ejoliet/indi-firefly} integrated and self contained ready to be connected to any INDI compatible devices.

\section{The architecture}

The architecture (see figure \ref{arch1}) used is a client/server type, where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The server is the Instrument Neutral Distributed Interface (INDI) Central hub for communication between compatible drivers and clients
  \item The client is a Front-end software that enables the user to interact with INDI compatible devices and other clients such as dome, CCD, weather forcast services, etc.
  \item The driver is the software to control INDI device and provide/expose its properties in a standard format -> connect to physical device
\end{itemize}

The goal was to develop and include the software stack in a docker image to be easily shared and run practically anywhere.
To run the client/server, install/run docker and have access to launch Firefly client and INDI/Kstars simulators\footnote{See demo guidelines: https://github.com/ejoliet/indi-firefly/blob/master/DEMO-guide.md}

\end{figure}

\section{Firefly}

Caltech/IPAC Firefly\footnote{https://github.com/Caltech-IPAC/firefly} is an open source Java/ReactJS library to build browser based visualization tools for astronomical data analysis and exploration and consist of 2 main mode of usage, the library can be iether imported from the result JavaScript API to build customized HTML pages or directly from Python.
Firefly Python client (\footnote{use command line 'pip install firefly\_client' to install python client})
Either way, the tools can make use of the widgets - See screenshots in figure \ref{ff} for Firefly use case examples.

IPAC contributing projects to Firefly are IRSA, NED and but other projects are using and integrating the library in their tools.

\end{figure}

\section{The client}

The client code developped during this project to control INDI compatible devices is the result of the integration of a Firefly Python client using custom callback extension and INDI client.
Kstars\footnote{https://kde.org/applications/education/org.kde.kstars} software is used to simulate INDI compatible devices such as a virtual telescope and a CCD and to visualize the tracking and the pointing of the field of view while controlling the telescope from Firefly web browser tool. See figure \ref{arch1}.

\section{Machine learning}

The idea is that before observing or tracking a target, a machine learning classifier need to be generated with the current telescope/devices setup on a sky sample.
The resulting model will represent the noise/calibration on the target position and will represent the offset tobe applied during the control loop on a real target.
In order to get the model the first step is to 'randomly' observe distributed known objects in the sky with accuarte position.

Pointing the telescope to an object and taking images will generate a 'training' set from which we can extract well-known positions. When pointing with the telescope, we can apply this offset for any susequent position target.
The ML model will include 'observer'/site/instrument/weather noise calibration unknown as part of the offset to be applied.

On every target pointing, we would run through the ML model that represents the current telescope settings/calibration to refine the pointing.

This step is till pending fro implementation and was suggested to be done using Autokeras\footnote{https://autokeras.com} classifier.

\section{Conclusion}

We have shown how to integrate Firefly's feature-rich visualization tools with other Python client APIs.
The project's source code and supporting materials for the application are open-source and available on GitHub.
